# ROBOTIC ARM USING ARDUINO

## Abstract
This project presents a joystick-controlled robotic arm developed using an Arduino Uno and servo motors.
The system allows real-time manual control of the robotic arm by translating analog joystick inputs into precise servo movements.
The project focuses on simplicity, affordability, and hands-on learning of basic robotics and embedded system concepts.

## Objective
- To design a manually controlled robotic arm using Arduino
- To understand servo motor control using PWM
- To process analog inputs from a joystick
- To gain practical exposure to robotics and embedded systems

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Servo Motors (2)
- Analog Joystick Module
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Battery Pack
- Ice cream sticks (arm structure)

📌 Status: Code and implementation details will be added step by step.
